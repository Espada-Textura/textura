## About Textura
Visual Art becomes more and more popular in this decade. Most people nowadays enjoy making visual artwork more than traditional drawing or painting. Obviously, everyone can be an artist by him/herself and produce such good arts in his/her own way of creativity. Recently, most people enjoy making visual artwork more than on paper.

There is no such good or bad art. An artist said, “Art is too important not to share”. Sharing artworks give artists many benefits. First of all, you gain recognition and that will boost your courage to make more. Second, you can express your emotion and feelings into it. Last but not least, it will become an idea for audiences who are seeing it.

Artists around the world are sharing their visual art every day to gain recognition. Presenting arts to audiences has been - and always will be - an important aspect of being an artist. Many artists use social media for posting or sharing their arts, but these platforms use a specific layout that can limit the way viewers consume the art presented to them. Moreover, these platforms are not specifically built for artwork posting or sharing.

As Cambodians, art is our soul; Nevertheless, the artists community seem to be being unwell-known. Many digital artists in Cambodia think that sharing their works in social media is not likely a good place. In order to improve our artists community, especially Visual Art (Digital Drawing/ Painting), we are creating a site where our artists can present their artworks. We, Espada Team, provide the most elegant and flexible website, Textura. Textura is a place, likely a community, for our Cambodian Artists to share their arts, earn recognition, express feeling and emotion through art, and more importantly is to improve the artist community in Cambodia. Textura mainly focuses on Digital Art and Digital painting. We are developing and growing bigger and will add more than just Digital Arts.
